# WDR_Football_predictions

The goal of the project is to check whether ther exist "Intelligence of the many" (Schwarmintelligenz) in the case of bets on football games. 
For that I scraped community prediction (with up to 90000 user predicting a matchday) from WDR. Than I downloaded the bet quotes + results for these games. 
The question now was if it is possible to earn money, if I bet 1â‚¬ on every game regarding what the the majority of the useres have bet. 
First I just bet on the favorit (on the team, that the majority of the users bet on) 
Second I bet on over/under 2.5 goals (based on the goals predictions per Team of the users) 
Third I bet on the trend (1x / x2 -> that the favorite team will not loose) 
--> Result: In each case I would have lost money (19.11.2020 , not much but still lost) 

In the end I tried some ML Approaches just. Also with those predections it is not possible to win money (19.11.2020)
